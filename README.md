# Personalized News Recommendation System

## Introduction

The **Personalized News Recommendation System** is designed to provide avid news readers with tailored recommendations based on their interests. By aggregating articles from various sources, this application uses Java and machine learning to suggest articles that align with user preferences and past interactions. With a graphical user interface (GUI), users can easily navigate and explore articles suited to their tastes.

## Problem Statement

Avid news readers have struggled with receiving irrelevant news recommendations, often leading to dissatisfaction with their news consumption experience. Additionally, there was a lack of an application that aggregates articles from multiple sources, leaving users with limited content options.

## Solution

This application aggregates articles from different sources and provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions. The GUI is built using Java, ensuring an interactive and user-friendly experience. The recommendation engine adapts to user feedback, continually improving the accuracy of suggestions over time.
